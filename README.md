# Hello Container

## Motivation

My first attempt at making a Dockerfile for containerizing a program that I have written. Starting small
and simple, we have `hello.py`.

## Prerequisites

Have the following installed:

- Python3
- Docker

## Program Execution

```sh
docker run -it hello-container hello.py
```
